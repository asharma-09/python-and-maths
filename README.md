# Python and Maths Projects

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of Python programs related to mathematical concepts, created as part of my learning journey in **programming and problem-solving**.

The projects start from basic mathematical programs and gradually move towards more complex concepts, helping me understand how mathematics can be implemented using Python.


## Below is a quick list of programs
- Number table generator (numtable.py)
- Fibonacci series generator (sewries-generator.py)
